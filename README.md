### Docker Benefits:
#### 1. Portability
Docker containers can run consistently across different environments (development, testing, production) without any platform differences. For example, a container running on your laptop will work the same on a cloud server.

#### 2. Isolation
Each Docker container is isolated from others. This is useful when running multiple servers or apps on the same machine without worrying about the compatibility issues.

#### 3. Scalability
Docker makes scaling apps easier. For example, if a web service is getting high traffic, you can easily add more containers and handle the load. When the load subsides, you can remove the container to save the resources.
